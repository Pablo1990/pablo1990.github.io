I earned my degree in Information Theory in 2015 at the University of Alicante. Then, I moved to Seville (Spain) to do a PhD in computational biology with LM Escudero. I became PhD by the University of Seville in 2020. One month later, I started to work with Yanlan Mao as a postdoctoral researcher at the Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology (LMCB), where I am currently working.</p>
