			<h2>The importance of communicating science</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Science is mainly funded by public money. Therefore, the public should know and understood what scientist do. That's why the scientists need to make an extra effor on explaing what we do, emphasizing its importance. It does not necessarily need to be applied science, but, for fundamental researchers, like me, it become critical to explain why and what we study.</p>

					<h3>Cloruro sodico ("Sodium chloride") a radio show</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Cloruro sodico was a radio program, in which Dario Ba√±o and me, talked about scientific news for ~15 minutes. It was live, so it came with many challenges for me (somedays in a different city 6 hours by car and talking via phone), but it was a beutiful and rewarding experience.</p>
